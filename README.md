# A Joint Network for Grasp Detection Conditioned on Natural Language Commands (CGNet)

A placeholder for the code release of the official implementation of the [A Joint Network for Grasp Detection Conditioned on Natural Language Commands](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00492) by Yiye Chen, Ruinian Xu, YUnzhi Lin, and Patricio A. Vela. 



## NOTE

For now some key information are released first, which does not attempt to provide runnables, but to give a sense of the data processing procedure. 

- ```templates.pkl```: The command templates

- ```vmrd_to_angle.py```: Key functions for loading the VMRD dataset
- ```add_commands.py```: Key functions for adding the commands to the loaded VMRD dataset
